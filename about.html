            <h2>About Us</h2>
           <div> <p>Love Green Nepal (LGN) is an autonomous, 
                non-governmental development organization (NGO)
                 established in 1991. It is a legal entity registered 
                 (Regd. No. 249/048/49) with Kathmandu District 
                 Administrative Office of Nepal Government under the 
                 Organization Registration Act of 1977. LGN is affiliated
                  (Affiliation No. 9149) to the Social Welfare Council 
                   coordinating and umbrella body of NGOs in Nepal.
                   It is also registered with Inland Revenue Department,
                    Kathmandu (PAN No.301708975).</p><br>
                    <p>It is an NGO run collectively by the Nepali nationals 
                        with diverse academic as well as professional expertise
                         and background ranging from management to community development.
                         LGN members and staffs work with a strong commitment 
                          contributing to upliftment of
                         low income people living in rural communities</p><br>
                         <p>In the beginning, LGN started its projects in Sankhu area of Kathmandu district in 1991. Its initial purpose was to develop greenery in the villages of rural Nepal. However, LGN gradually adopted other activities like school building construction, biogas plant installation, girl students scholarship, etc. and finally started to work in an integrated community development approach.

                            LGN intends to contribute to creating economically sustainable, environmentally sound and socially peaceful and harmonious communities. For this, it strives to promote sustainable model communities which fundamentally thrive on utilization of their own internal resources. With this in mind, LGN is making efforts to develop sustainable livelihoods for economically disadvantaged people in marginalized communities in rural settings.
                            
                            At present, LGN is implementing its projects mainly in 2 districts of Nepal namely Kavrepalanchok and Lalitpur. The on-going projects are: Environment Friendly Integrated Sustainable Agriculture Development Project, Public School Physical Facility Development Project, and Girl Students Scholarship Project.
                            
                            LGN’s projects are funded by foreign donors, INGOs, and individual donors mainly Japanese.</p></div>
